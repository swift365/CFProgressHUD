## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

`CFProgressHUD` works on iOS 9.0+ and requires ARC to build. It depends on the following Apple frameworks, which should already be included with most Xcode templates:

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode8+
- Swift 3

You will need the latest developer tools in order to build `CFProgressHUD`. Old Xcode versions might work, but compatibility will not be explicitly maintained.

## Adding CFProgressHUD to your project

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add CFProgressHUD to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for CFProgressHUD to your Podfile `pod 'CFProgressHUD', '~> 0.1.0'`
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.

## Installation

CFProgressHUD is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
